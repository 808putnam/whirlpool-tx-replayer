## Requirements
### Software
- Rust (cargo + rustc)
- Docker (docker)
- MariaDB CLI (mysql)

### Disk
- 10 GB for MariaDB (Docker)
- some GB for rust compiler

### Memory
- 1 GB for MariaDB
- 0.5 GB for whirlpool-tx-replayer

## Build whirlpool-tx-replayer
debug build is much slower than release build, so please use debug build for the debugging only.
```
cargo build --release
```

## Setup Transaction DB with exported data
### startup MariaDB container on Docker
download the latest mariadb image.
```
docker image pull mariadb
```

start the container named txdb
- root password: password
- port: 3306
```
docker container run --name txdb -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=password -dp 3306:3306 mariadb
```

check if the container is running
```
docker container ls
```
```
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE     COMMAND                   CREATED         STATUS         PORTS                    NAMES
b9d69b45ade8   mariadb   "docker-entrypoint.sâ€¦"   6 seconds ago   Up 5 seconds   0.0.0.0:3306->3306/tcp   txdb
```

### download exported data
- approx 1.2 GB
- minimum slot: 214824664 (September 01, 2023 00:00:00 +UTC)
- maximum slot: 224369122 (October 18, 2023 03:30:50 +UTC)
- all tables, views and stored procedures(functions) are included
- [DDL for tables and stored procedures](https://github.com/everlastingsong/sedimentology/blob/main/src/sql/definition.sql)
- [DDL for views](https://github.com/orca-so/whirlpool-tx-replayer/blob/main/sql/view.sql)
```
curl -L -o whirlpool-transactions-214824664-224369122.dump.sql.gz https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/eyokubd0h1m967w7skwsj/whirlpool-transactions-214824664-224369122.dump.sql.gz?rlkey=z4pd383bbzfq21yettv9dru9e&dl=1
```

### import exported data
create empty database named "whirlpool"
```
mysqladmin -u root -p -h localhost -P 3306 create whirlpool
```

import data into "whirlpool" database
```
gunzip -c whirlpool-transactions-214824664-224369122.dump.sql.gz | mysql -u root -p -h localhost -P 3306 whirlpool
```

### sanity check
```
mysql -u root -p -h localhost -P 3306 whirlpool -e "SELECT COUNT(*) as slots, MIN(slot) as oldest, MAX(slot) as latest FROM slots"
```
```
+---------+-----------+-----------+
| slots   | oldest    | latest    |

```

```
mysql -u root -p -h localhost -P 3306 whirlpool -e "SELECT table_name, table_rows FROM information_schema.tables WHERE table_schema = 'whirlpool' AND table_name LIKE 'ixs%' ORDER BY table_rows DESC"

- will take several minutes (~10min, CPU intensive)
- will load ``tests/input-snapshot/whirlpool-snapshot-215135999.csv.gz`` as start point
- will do replay based on whirlpool instructions extracted from the transaction DB
- will save some snapshot into ``tests/output-snapshot``
- will stop at slot 215150000+
- you can verify the correctness of the replaying by comparing snapshots between ``tests/output-snapshot`` and ``tests/target-snapshot``. please see [README](https://github.com/orca-so/whirlpool-tx-replayer/blob/main/tests/output-snapshot/README.md) for details.


## TODO
### ~~Performance tuning~~
~~Now I believe that it can process 50 slots per seconds in average, and it is x20 faster than real validators.~~
~~But there is obvious hot spot and it is whirlpool program compilation everytime to execute transaction.~~

After eliminating program loading, replayer can process 2 days worth slots in 40 minutes. It is approx x70 replay performance! ðŸ”¥

### ~~Set Compute Budget~~
Allow instruction to use more compute budget.

### ~~Use 1.16.18~~
Now patch for solana-storage-proto can be removed.

### Support all instruction
The following instructions do not yet implement replay.
They are only rarely executed, and they are not technically difficult.

- InitializeConfig
- ~~InitializeFeeTier~~
- SetCollectProtocolFeesAuthority
- SetDefaultFeeRate
- SetDefaultProtocolFeeRate
- SetFeeAuthority
- ~~SetFeeRate~~
- SetProtocolFeeRate
- SetRewardAuthority
- SetRewardAuthorityBySuperAuthority
- SetRewardEmissionsSuperAuthority
- AdminIncreaseLiquidity

### Validation at instruction level
By performing the following verification before and after each instruction is executed, abnormal situations may be detected at an early stage.

- Accounts that should not exist do not exist
- Accounts that should exist do exist
- Token volume consistent with the transaction log has been transferred

### More performance tuning
- ConfirmedTransactionWithStatusMeta::encode in execute_transaction is the next hotspot
- Delete unused features such as token balance snapshots


### think: use RDBMS to store Whirlpool account snapshots
At the moment, simple gzipped csv files on Filesystem is used.

### think: direct use from Node.js (Typescript) similar to Bankrun

### solana-poc-framework

``ReplayEnvironment`` is a modification of poc-framework's ``LocalEnvironment``. Because there were some points that were not suitable for replay, ``LocalEnvironment`` was copied and reworked into ``ReplayEnvironment``.
